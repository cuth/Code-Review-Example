This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setup

In the root directory, copy the contents of .env.default to a file called .env and supply the appropriate variables from the Airtable you would like to use. On that Airtable, check Help > API Documentation for the URLs and how to get your API key.

You'll also need to have npm installed, check [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) if you don't.
Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

## Running

Start the app in development mode with `npm start`. Visit `localhost:3000` in your browser, and enter some data to post to Airtable!
